## Description

* Lorenz.py - Generates a randomized Lorenz system.
* LorenzRK4vsEuler.py - Compares along a time series the divergence of the Lorenz system given the same initial conditions where one is solved through RK4 integration and the other by first order Euler integration.
* aniLorenz.py - An animataed graph of the behavior of the Lorenz system.
* doublePend.py - Animated graph of a double pendulum's state.
* doublePendNoPhase.py - Double pendulum simulation.
* gravRand.py - Randomized n-body problem. 
* gravRandHackyTrack.py - Uses a "hacky" trick that adds dampening when two particles get too close.
* gravRandMap.py - Creates a phase-space-like map of an entire 3-body system.
* gravRandMapPregen.py - Generates a non-animated map of a 3-body system.
* gravRandTrack.py - Tracks a single particle in an n-body system.
* logisticdifference.py - Graphs the logistic difference equation.
* logisticmap.py - Maps the behavior of the logistic difference equation on a map, creating the famous logistic map.
* lorenz2D.py - Maps only part of the lorenz system such that we get a 2D slice.
* lorenzRK4.py - Lorenz system integrated using RK4.
* lorenzTimeSeries.py - The Lorenz system along a time series.
* lorenzrayleigh.py - Graphs the Lorenz system's behavior given different values for Rayleigh's number. Shows the exact point that "chaos" occurs for given parameters. 
* lorenzrayleighNoSettle.py - Graphs the Lorenz system's behavior without letting it settle first given different values for Rayleigh's number.
* multiLorenz.py - Graphs multiple random lorenz systems side by side.
* pendWithDrag.py - Demonstrates a common pendulum system with drag and phase plane.
* simplePend.py - Demonstrates a common pendulum system without drag and phase plane.
* simplePendNoPhase.py - Demonstrates a simple pendulum without a phase plane.
